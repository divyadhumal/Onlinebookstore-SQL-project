# 🛒 Online Bookstore – SQL Project

Hi! 👋 This is my **first project on GitHub** — a basic **Online Bookstore Database** created using **SQL**.  
The project includes database table creation, inserting sample data, and performing useful queries to analyze and interact with the data.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Online Book Store.sql` – contains everything:
  - Table creation (`Books`, `Customers`, `Orders`)
  - Sample `SELECT` queries (basic to advanced)
  - Business logic queries like total sales, most ordered book, remaining stock, etc.

## 🗄️ Tables Created

1. **Books** – Book details including title, author, genre, price, and stock  
2. **Customers** – Customer info like name, email, city, country  
3. **Orders** – Order details including date, quantity, and total amount
